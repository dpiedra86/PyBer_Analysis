# PyBer_Analysis.

## Project Overview

This project was extremely helpful to understand how data behaves when the output should be a visual interface. Having information visualized in a graphic way is a really useful tool to understand big data sets in one or a few images. It is very important to understand which kind of data we have or being very clear on what we are looking for, before making any decision  as the final output will dictaminate which  visualization will be the most accurate to see the information. 

With this excersise we also used Pandas to organize the information. This makes it really easy to manipulate large data sets and organize it in a way matplotlib can very easily undertand to make the visualizations.
