# PyBer_Analysis.

## Project Overview

This project was extremely helpful to understand how data behaves when the output should be a visual interface. Having information visualized in a graphic way is a really useful tool to understand big data sets in one or a few images. It is very important to understand which kind of data we have or being very clear on what we are looking for, before making any decision  as the final output will dictaminate which  visualization will be the most accurate to see the information. 

With this excersise we also used Pandas to organize the information. This makes it really easy to manipulate large data sets and organize it in a way matplotlib can very easily undertand to make the visualizations. 

### Results

> Cities_dataframe

In the following Data set we can observe with clarity how each type of city behaves in terms of number of rides and gains.
As it may seem that with a higher fare rate the business should be making more incomes, the reality is that even with a smaller rate in the average fares in urban a high volume on trips genrates a better income.

> Conclusions

- A higher volume of trips even whith smaller fares, is more efficient to generate income than a larger fare average with a low volume on trips.  Fig 1 & 2
- The tendency remains very similar in the 3 areas along the calendar, with ups and downs still follows a pattern. Fig 1
- Urban areas have a higher demand. Suburban areas are good enough to make a good revenue while keeping a fair share of trips, making them rentable as well. Fig 2 
- Rural areas are not as rentable as the other two but still manage to keep higher rates due to the longer trips we assume. Fig 2
- Hollidays keep a lower number of trip equally, as we can see in January. Fig 1
- We should see how seasonalities affect the behavior of the plat lines.  Fig 1

Recomendatgions

Mantain the focus in Urban areas as the source of growth for the business. 
Keep this order in mind for the rotation of the vehicles : New Vehicles - Urban Areas , 2-3 years Suburban areas, 4 and more Rural Areas
Analyze seasonalities and special ocations in the calendar to catch  new business opportunities.
